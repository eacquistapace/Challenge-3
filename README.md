# Challenge-3

**Main Objective**

Random password generator powered by JavaScript. A user clicks the 'Generate Password' button in order to begin choosing paramaters for their password. User is able to choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters- will be prompted if they attempt to choose more or less than the required length, otherwise will confirm password length selection. User is then able to choose whether they would like to choose uppercase, lowercase, numbers, or special characters to be included in their password- user will need to choose at least 1 character set (can choose up to all 4). Once user selects length of password and characters to be included, a password will be randomly generated and displayed to the user in a text box.

**Additional Notes**

Yay, I was able to figure this out! I feel that the JS is a little lengthy and repetitive when it comes to character selection. It functions smoothly though and presents the user with a randomized code, which was my goal.
